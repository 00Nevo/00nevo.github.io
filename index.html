                    <li>Education Science, Social Law, and Empirical Social Methods (using SPSS)</li>
                    <li>I even attended courses on <strong>ArcGIS</strong> and <strong>R</strong> (for statistical analysis) through the Faculty of Geography.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Currently Learning 🌱</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>R:</strong> Enhancing my skills in statistical analysis and data science.</li>
            <li><strong>Lua:</strong> Exploring game development and scripting with Lua.</li>
            <li><strong>Python:</strong> Deepening my knowledge in programming and automation.</li>
            <li><strong>HTML:</strong> Improving my web development skills and creating accessible websites.</li>
            <li><strong>Git and GitHub:</strong> Continuing to learn how to effectively collaborate and manage projects using version control.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Collaboration & Projects 💞</h2>
        <p>I'm particularly interested in collaborating on projects involving:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>R:</strong> Data science and statistical analysis.</li>
            <li><strong>Lua:</strong> Game development and scripting.</li>
            <li><strong>HTML:</strong> Web development and creating functional websites.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Fun Facts ⚡</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The first operating system I learned (other than Windows) was <strong>Mac OS</strong>. I used to experiment with <strong>Photoshop</strong> and <strong>Illustrator</strong> because my mom had a design studio. I particularly enjoyed creating in <strong>Bryce</strong>.</li>
            <li>I had a <strong>MySpace</strong> page back in the day, and from 2008 to 2019, I was the <strong>webmaster</strong> for a website with over 2,000 users. This experience gave me a lot of insight into <strong>moderation</strong> and occasional <strong>code checks</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
