        <ul>
            <li><strong>Languages</strong> I speak: French, Spanish, Italian, English, and German.</li>
            <li><strong>Background:</strong> I completed my <strong>Bachelor's in Gerontology</strong> at Vechta University in Germany. Gerontology is an interdisciplinary field focused on the study of aging. During my studies, I covered a wide range of topics, including:
                <ul>
                    <li>Sociology, Psychology, Politics, and Economics</li>
                    <li>Healthcare, Medicine, and Neuroscience</li>
                    <li>Education Science, Social Law, and Empirical Social Methods (using SPSS)</li>
                    <li>I even attended courses on <strong>ArcGIS</strong> and <strong>R</strong> (for statistical analysis) through the Faculty of Geography.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Currently Learning ðŸŒ±</h2>
        <p>I am currently focusing on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Python</strong>: Deepening my knowledge in programming and automation.</li>
            <li><strong>Java</strong>: Learning object-oriented programming and developing scalable applications.</li>
            <li><strong>JavaScript</strong>: Improving my skills in web development and interactive front-end development.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Additional Secondary Interests ðŸ’¡</h2>
        <p>I'm also exploring and interested in:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>R</strong>: Data science and statistical analysis.</li>
            <li><strong>SQL</strong>: Database management and querying.</li>
            <li><strong>C++</strong>: System programming and performance optimization.</li>
            <li><strong>Rust</strong>: Safe and efficient systems programming.</li>
            <li><strong>Clojure</strong>: Functional programming and concurrency.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Collaboration & Projects ðŸ’ž</h2>
        <p>I'm particularly interested in collaborating on projects involving:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>R</strong>: Data science and statistical analysis.</li>
            <li><strong>HTML</strong>: Web development and creating websites.</li>
            <li><strong>Python</strong>: Programming, automation, and data analysis.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you have any beginner-friendly project suggestions or ideas, feel free to reach out! I'd love to collaborate or discuss ideas.</p>

        <h2>Reach Out ðŸ“«</h2>
        <p>You can contact me via email: <a href="mailto:albertoborgato9@googlemail.com">albertoborgato9@googlemail.com</a>.</p>

        <h2>Fun Facts âš¡</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The first operating system I learned (other than Windows) was <strong>Mac OS</strong>. I used to experiment with <strong>Photoshop</strong> and <strong>Illustrator</strong> because my mom had a design studio. I particularly enjoyed creating in <strong>Bryce</strong>.</li>
            <li>I had a <strong>MySpace</strong> page back in the day, and from 2008 to 2019, I was the <strong>webmaster</strong> for a website with over 2,000 users. This experience gave me a lot of insight into <strong>moderation</strong> and occasional <strong>code checks</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
